# Îž effect

Compared to other languages with effect handlers (and support for polymorphic effects) the effect language
aims to be significantly more lightweight in its concepts.


## Disclaimer: Use at your own risk

**effect is a research-level language. We are actively working on it and the language (and everything else) is very likely to change.**

Also, effect comes with no warranty and there are (probably) many bugs -- If this does not discourage you, feel free to
play with it and give us your feedback :)

## Installation

You need to have Java (>= 11) and Node (>= 10) and npm installed.

The recommended way of installing effect is by running:

```
npm install -g https://github.com/effect-lang/effect/releases/latest/download/effect.tgz
```

Alternatively, you can download the `effect.tgz` file from [another release](https://github.com/effect-lang/effect/releases) and then run

```
npm install -g effect.tgz
```

This will make the `effect` command globally available. You can start the effect REPL by entering:

```
> effect
```

You can find more information about the effect language and how to use it on the website (<https://effect-lang.org>).
